# Master's application

This script was written for my application to the Data Science Msc at the Uva.
It takes a text file provided and processes them into a dictionary structure 
of which the key is a word from the text and its value a linked list that shows
the orrurances of the same word in other articles. It finally plots the values
to show the distribution of word frequencies.
